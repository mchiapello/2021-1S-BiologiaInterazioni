This is exactly how it seems when you try to figure out how authors got from a large and complex data set to a dense paper with lots of busy figures.
Without access to the data and the analysis code, a miracle occurred.

## Common practice of writing statistical reports:
.font150[
- We import a dataset into .red[Excel]
- Run a procedure to get all results
- .blue[Copy and paste] selected pieces into a typesetting program (usually .red[Word])
- Add a few descriptions
- Finish a report
]

# What reproducible research is

## There are obvious dangers and disadvantages in this process:
.font160[
1. It is .bold[error-prone] due to too much manual work;
2. It requires lots of human effort to do .bold[tedious jobs];
3. The workflow is barely recordable, therefore it is .bold[difficult to reproduce];
4. A .bold[tiny change] of the data source in the future will require the author(s) to go through the same procedure again;
5. The analysis and writing are separate, so close attention has to be paid to the .bold[synchronization of the two parts].

# What reproducible research is
.font120[
.bold[Reproducibility/reproduce]   
A study is reproducible if there is a specific set of computational functions/analyses (usually specified in terms of code) that .red[exactly reproduce all of the numbers in a published paper from raw data].

.bold[Replication/replicate]    
A study is only replicable if you perform the exact same experiment (at least) twice, collect data in the same way both times, perform the same data analysis, and .red[arrive at the same conclusions].

----

.bold[Reproducibility] is, to some extent, a .red[technical challenge], while   
.bold[Replication] .red[gives to the results scientific validity].]

Reproducible Research Rules
]]]

.marco[

]

---
class: large

# Rule 1

## For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced

--

- The **full sequence** of pre- and post-processing steps are often critical in order to reach the achieved result

- **Every detail** that may influence the execution of the step **should be recorded**

- Include the name and **version of the program**, as well as the exact parameters and inputs

.content-box-gray[As a minimum, you should at least **record sufficient details** on **programs, parameters, and manual procedures** to allow yourself, in a year or so,   
to approximately reproduce the results]

---
# Rule 2

## Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps

--

.font120[
- .red[Manual procedures are not only **inefficient and error-prone**, they are also **difficult to reproduce**]
- .red[Manual operations like the use of **copy and paste** between documents **should also be avoided**]
- Manual modification of files can usually be replaced by the use of standard **UNIX commands** or scripts
- Manual tweaking of data files to attain format compatibility should be replaced by **format converters** that can be reenacted and **included into executable workflows**
]

.content-box-gray[If manual operations cannot be avoided, you should as
a minimum    
**note down which data files were modified or moved, and for what purpose**]

---
# Rule 3

## Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used

--
.font120[
- In order to exactly reproduce a given result, it may be necessary to use programs in the **exact versions used originally**
- It is **not always trivial to get hold of a program** in anything but the current version
]
<br><br>
.content-box-gray[As a minimum, you should note
the **exact names** and **versions** of the main programs you use]

---
# Rule 4

## Version Control All Custom Scripts

--

.font120[
- Only that **exact state of the script** may be able to produce that **exact output**, even **given the same input data and parameters**
- The standard solution to **track evolution of code** is to use a version control system
  - .font70[A version control system is a **repository of files** with monitored access.]
  - .font70[**Every change** made to the source **is tracked**, along with who made the change, why they made it]
]

<br>
.content-box-gray[As a minimum, you should **archive copies 
of your scripts** from time to time]

---
# Rule 5

## Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats

--

.font120[
- In principle, as long as the **full process** used to produce a given result **is tracked**, all **intermediate data can also be regenerated**
- In practice, having easily accessible intermediate results may be of great value (eg, to **spot errors**)
- When the full process is not readily executable, it allows parts of the process to be rerun
- **It allows critical examination** of the full process behind a result
]

<br>
.content-box-gray[As a minimum, **archive any intermediate result files** that are produced when running an analysis]

---
# Rule 6

## For Analyses That Include Randomness, Note Underlying Random Seeds

--
.font120[
- Many analyses and predictions include some **element of randomness**, meaning the same program will typically give **slightly different results every time it is executed**
- **Given the same initial seed**, all random numbers used in an analysis will be equal, thus giving identical results every time it is run
]
<br>

.content-box-gray[As a minimum, you should **note which analysis steps involve randomness**, so that a certain level of discrepancy can be anticipated when reproducing the results]

---
# Rule 7

## Always Store Raw Data

--
<br><br>
.content-box-gray[
.font150[
.f500[
Always store in a safe place the raw data
]
]
]
<br>
.content-box-gray[
.font150[
.f500[
Never touch or mofidy the raw data
]
]
]

---
# Rule 8

## Generate Hierarchical Analysis Output, Allowing Layers of Increasing Detail to Be Inspected (test units)

.font120[
- The **final results** that make it to an article, be it plots or tables, often represent **highly summarized data**
- In order to validate and fully understand the main result, it is often useful to **inspect the detailed values** underlying the summaries
]

<br>

.content-box-gray[
When working with summarized results, you should as a minimum at least once   
**generate, inspect, and validate the detailed values** underlying the summaries
]

---
# Rule 9

## Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results

--

.font120[
- The results of analyses and their corresponding textual interpretations are clearly interconnected but **often lie in different places**
- Results usually live on a personal computer, while interpretations live in text documents
- To allow efficient retrieval of details behind textual statements, we suggest that **statements are connected to underlying results already from the time the statements are initially formulated**
]

.content-box-gray[
**Integrate reproducible analyses directly into textual documents**    
.font120[**RMarkdown**]
]

---
# Rule 10

## Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results

--

.font120[
- All input data, scripts, versions, parameters, and inter-mediate results should be made **publicly and easily accessible**
- Making reproducibility of your work by peers a realistic possibility sends a **strong signal of quality, trustworthiness, and transparency**

# Tools

## Project organization 

We strongly advise to split your project in folder and not dumpo everything on the desktop.

1. **README file**: explain the purpose of the project and describe the folder/files in it

1. **RAWDATA folder**: contains the rawdata. We advise to have it with "read only permission"

1. **SCRIPT folder**: contains the script used for your analysis

1. **ANALYSIS folder**: contains the results of your analysis

# Tools

## Version Control

.pull-rigth[
<br><br>
.font120[
**Version control software** keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can **turn back the clock** and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

# Conclusion

.font120[
- Learning to use these tools will **require commitment and a massive investment of your time and energy**

- **A priori** it is not clear why the benefits of working reproducibly outweigh its costs.

- Does reproducibility sound like **extra work**?

- It can be, particularly when one is first trying to do it, that is, to **break oneâ€™s own previous nonreproducible habits**
